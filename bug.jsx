In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, including a blank screen or an error in the console.  The problem might stem from incorrect path definitions, typos in the `<Link>` component, or a mismatch between client-side and server-side routing configurations. Consider this example: 
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <Link to="/home">Home</Link> <Link to="/abount">About</Link> {/*Typo here*/}
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
The typo in `/abount` will cause the link to fail silently, leaving the user on the same page.
